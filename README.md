# Gandhara-Sculptures-Dataset
Gandhara Sculptures Dataset Develop for Machine Learning Training and Testing.

## Dataset Features
Dataset is used for Machine Learning algorithm to train the and test the modal to detect the Artifact and convert the features of detected Artifact in Description about the history of the artifact.
This Dataset Cosists of Images and 3-5 description of each image. This is a unique concept to detect the historical artifact using Machine Learning algorithm. It saves lot of time of reseachers, scholors and students of history and Archeology. It saves lot of their time in detecting the Artifact.
